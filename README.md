# py-music-app

In this project I created a music app using 
1.) pip install django
2.) cd ./website
3.) python manage.py runserver
4.) Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin to access the admin page (user: andreighervan, password: 123andrei)
5.) You can edit albums and songs from admin
6.) Go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/music/ to see the front end of the site
